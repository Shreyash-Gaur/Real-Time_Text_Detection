# OCR Battle: ðŸ¤– Keras | ðŸ“· pytesseract | ðŸš€ EasyOCR
### AIM
To conduct a comprehensive analysis of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems, specifically comparing the performance of Keras-OCR, Pytesseract, and EasyOCR algorithms on text extraction from images.
### Objectives
**1.** Evaluate the accuracy and robustness of Keras-OCR, Pytesseract, and EasyOCR in extracting textual content from images under various conditions, including different text styles, fonts, sizes, orientations, and backgrounds.

**2.** Compare the computational efficiency and resource utilization of the OCR algorithms to determine their suitability for real-time or large-scale text extraction tasks.

**3.** Assess the scalability of each OCR system by analyzing its performance across datasets of varying sizes and complexities.

**4.** Investigate the impact of preprocessing techniques, such as image enhancement and noise reduction, on OCR accuracy and reliability.

**5.** Explore the potential limitations and failure modes of each OCR system and identify areas for improvement or optimization.

**6.** Provide actionable insights and recommendations for selecting the most suitable OCR solution based on specific use cases and requirements.
### Outcome
A comprehensive analysis report detailing the comparative evaluation of Keras-OCR Pytesseract, and EasyOCR algorithms for text extraction from images, along with actionable recommendations for selecting the most appropriate OCR solution for various practical applications.
